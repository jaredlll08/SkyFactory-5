#Welcome to SkyFactory 5
#If you're reading this then I am sorry.
#You have been chosen to embark on a very long, tedious, extremely grindy, yet meaningful trek into a beautiful mess of blocks, items, and other weird stuff. This pack is not finished and will probably have lots of bugs, issues, problems, lag, messes, worriment, questionable choices, headaches, heart aches, aches in places you didn't knew existed, obstacles, and dragons.
===
#When will it be out you might ask? That depends, how much money do you have? Just kidding! But seriously, if you have to ask you probably can't afford it. No but really, it's going to be out when it's ready and that depends on how fast MisterWiggly here can work on reporting bugs and other anomalies.

#TLDR: This pack is currently very sucks and it needs a lot of fixing.

#HAVE FUN!
===
#Special Thank You to:
#FirstNecron, MarioLuigi7896, Jaredlll08, Muddr, Lothrazar, GoryMoon, Shadows_of_Fire, MrBysco, BlayTheNinth, KingLemming
#and more people will be added to this list!
