# Welcome to SkyFactory® 5
#§1============================
#You probably noticed there's no color! Don't worry, your computer isn't broken. Each of the 16 Minecraft Colors will have to be discovered in a variety of ways: Crafting, in-world actions, etc. If you get stuck, the Advancements should help you out.

# How to Use This Book
#Use the arrows at the bottom of the pages to navigate the book. You will see challenges separated into ages that represent the general path of progression, although you do not need to do them in order. Simply check the box next to each challenge on completion. Careful though, tasks become increasingly difficult as you progress! Also, don't forget to craft yourself a Task Table to store this book!

#§1--==§ Mob Spawning§1==--

#In SkyFactory 5, mobs spawn differently than previous modpacks or vanilla. Mobs will not spawn naturally and require you to complete Gateways to obtain a Trophy. You can then place and activate the Trophy to spawn only that mob. Mobs will spawn on most blocks and don't require specific blocks like Grass or Water. You do not need to worry about Biomes, Dimensions, or Y levels as mob spawning is not dependent on these.

#Light levels will matter when spawning mobs. Friendly mobs will spawn in light levels 8 to 15 while hostile mobs will need light levels 0 to 7. You can easily find the light level by pressing F7.

#Mobs will spawn from Spawners found in the world. You can then collect the Spawners, upgrade them, and use a Trophy on the Spawner to change what mob it will spawn.
